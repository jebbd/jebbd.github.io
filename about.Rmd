I am bioinformatician and data scientist based in Dublin, Ireland. 

During my PhD I studied the evolution and mitochondrial genetics of extreme longevity in bats, before moving on to a postdoc in [Dr. Michael Hiller's lab](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/michael-hiller/group-members/) at the Centre for Systems Biology in Dresden. In Dresden, I worked on the evolution of gene losses in mammals and on genome annotation for the [Bat1K](https://bat1k.com/) and other projects.

In 2019, I joined the sequencing lab at Genuity Science where my role covers bioinformatics, data science and cloud management. In 2021, I took up a position as a Bioinformatician and Principal Data Scientist with Optum Ireland.
