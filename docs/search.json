      "contents": "\nI am bioinformatician and data scientist based in Dublin, Ireland.\nDuring my PhD I studied the evolution and mitochondrial genetics of extreme longevity in bats, before moving on to a postdoc in Dr. Michael Hiller’s lab at the Centre for Systems Biology in Dresden. In Dresden, I worked on the evolution of gene losses in mammals and on genome annotation for the Bat1K and other projects.\nIn 2019, I joined the sequencing lab at Genuity Science where my role covers bioinformatics, data science and cloud management.\n\n\n\n",
