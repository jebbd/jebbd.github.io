In Dresden, I worked on the evolution of gene losses in mammals and on genome annotation for the Bat1K and other projects.\nIn 2019, I joined the sequencing lab at Genuity Science where my role covers bioinformatics, data science and cloud management. In 2021, I took up a position as a Bioinformatician and Principal Data Scientist with Optum Ireland.\n\n\n\n",
